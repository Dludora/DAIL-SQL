SELECT T1.ShipmentID FROM Shipment AS T1 JOIN Has_Clearance AS T2 ON T1.ShipmentID = T2.Shipment WHERE T2.Employee = (SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employee WHERE Name = "Phillip J. Fry")
SELECT Explanation: To answer this question, we can use a SQL query that joins the Shipment table with the Employee table on the Manager column. We can then filter the results to only include shipments managed by Phillip J Fry, whose name is "Phillip J Fry". The query would look like this: SELECT ShipmentID FROM Shipment JOIN Employee ON Manager = EmployeeID WHERE Name = "Phillip J Fry"
SELECT Date FROM Shipment
SELECT Date FROM Shipment

SELECT T1.ShipmentID FROM Shipment AS T1 JOIN Employee AS T2 ON T1.Manager = T2.EmployeeID WHERE T2.Name = "Turanga Leela" AND T1.Planet = (SELECT PlanetID FROM Planet WHERE Name = "Mars")
